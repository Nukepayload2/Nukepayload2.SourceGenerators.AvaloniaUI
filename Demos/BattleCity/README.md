## What is this? Why?

This is a stub for a 2D game. The purpose of the project was to demonstrate that one can write a 2D game in AvaloniaUI without writing any rendering code.

## Features

- 2D Tiles
- Cell-aligned game objects
- Has basic implementation of a typical game loop
- No rendering code, everything is done using AvaloniaUI data binding and a few ValueConverters
